# Contracts

## Introduction

A source of truth for escalation to a vendor or supplier in an emergancy.

## Pattern

Each vendor contract for each product or service should be captured in text
format in this directory. A summary version and a full version might be
useful.

## Sensitive Data

By and large information in contracts is not sensitive. When it is found to be
sensitive the encryption tool of Ansible Vault could be used to encrypt details
in place. See the methods used in the Licenes directory to handle secrets.

Example:

```
ansible-vault encrypt ../Contracts/Local_Government/Articles_of_Incorporation.md
```
