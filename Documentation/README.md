# Document all the things

If you ever want to take vacation, make sure to document things.

## Markdown

Markdown is what the .md means on the end of documentation files. It is a simple text formating that is readable. It can be rendered in a pretty format with tools. There are some very [basic formating](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) guides to help you along.

## Documents
